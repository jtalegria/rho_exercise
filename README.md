# RHO | Application Exercise

### Project Description
The main aim of the proposed challenge can be interpreted and divided into two steps:
 - Build a backend system, in which I chose Python language, that would interpret a json file with sports data and elaborate the endpoints to:
		
	 - List all sports
	 - List all events for a given sport
	 - List all outcomes for a given event
	 
 - Build a frontend solution, in ReactJS, that expresss the correct functioning of the developed endpoints.

### Project Structure and Dependencies
The structure of this project is organized into two main directories:

 - backend
 - frontend
 
In order to execute the project, as well as the installation of the dependencies, it is necessary to install [***python***](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (checking if [***pip***](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) is already installed), [***django-rest-framework***](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/#installation) (through pip) and [***npm***](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

After doing so, if you had downloaded the folder **node_modules**, proceed to the next topic. If you haven't, to install the dependencies access the *frontend/react-website* directory and run the following command ***npm install***.


 
### Project Execution
After the previous topic is completed, simply navigate first to the backend directory, and run:

> (backend/api)
>$ python3 manage.py runserver

Then, to be able to run the Frontend project, navigate to the directory, run the command below and a new browser window will pop up.

> (frontend/react-website)
>$ npm start

### Limitations
One of the goals was to get the json file, in run-time, knowing that it was not accessible in Portugal.
Since I could not reach this goal, I downloaded the file and worked out the necessary parse to complete the challenge.
